    <p> Hello I am Seraj Ettaleb and I am a young goalkeeper. Today I will tell you how to become a better
        goalkeeper.
       The first step to becoming a better goalkeeper is to know how to react in certain situations
     . For example if a defender is coming towards the goal you must stop the goal by doing 
     what you think is necccery.In diffrent situations you will preform diffrent kinds of saves 
     such as a dive save,a split save and many other saves. The second step to becoming a beter
     goalkeeper is to know how to communicate with your team. Now you may think well "Isn't it 
     important for all players on the feild to communicate with other players." Now this is true
     but a goalkeeper must be able to communicate with the players to tell them to cover some one
     or what kind of pass is it like is it a cross or is it a direct pass. Now goalkeepers should 
     call if they are going to catch it or if a player should clear the ball. Now remmmber
     these calls should be used corectly because if not the opponet will score a goal.
     The third step to becoming a better goalkeeper is to being able to know what method of 
     distripution you are going to use will it be a roll, a throw, or a punt to your teammate.
     for a short pass roll the ball. For a little farter pass throw the ball and for a far pass 
     down to the other side of the feild ues a punt. Now there are to types of punts the normal 
     punt and the side winner punt. Now bot these punts go the same distance and height but a 
     normall punt would be to get the ball up to anyone. The sidewiner on the other side is used 
     to get the ball to a specific location on the feild. The fourth step to becoming a better 
     goalkeeper is being able  to a react and know where the ball is on the feild. This is the Number One 
     thing a goalkeeper has to be aware of. Your reaction determins if you will be able to get to the ball
     fast enough and be able to save it. When you know wher the ball is ont the pitch you will be able to 
     react fast enough to save the ball. The fifth an final step to becoming a better goalkeeper is to have 
     a positive mind atitude. This is important because if you are not positive then you will not save the ball
     or you may not be alble to play good enough. Allways say you will get to the ball or you will play good
     because you will get to save more goals. Lastly don't belive what others say to make you mad or sad
     because they probablly don't know how hard it is to be a goalkeeper.
